When two cows brush up against each other while roaming the pasture on a sunlit afternoon, or when a female cow gives birth to a newborn calf, that journey is recorded in the form of scratches, scars, or slight variations in color and thickness. We know our customers are singular, original people, which is why we embrace these natural variations and create leather custom pieces with character. \n♦ We use a vintage typeset to stamp all items. Because every letter has a unique shape, the spacing between each hand-stamped letter will not be exactly the same.\n♦ Foil is a lovely accent and a great way to make your personalization stand out! However, please note that with time and frequent use, the foil will start to fade.\n  \n\nProduction and Shipping Time\n\n♦ Production time is 1-2 business days. \n♦ Shipping takes 3-8 days for delivery. \n♦ All products are custom, handmade, made to order. \n♦ If you have any questions, please message us.\n \n\n[ ABOUT Northwind  ]\n\n✓ Handmade in the USA and ships from the USA\n\n✓ We make leather goods and accessories that are perfect for mothers day, fathers day, graduation, christmas, valentines day, third anniversary and so much more\n\n✓ Northwind items make the best wedding gifts, groomsmen gifts, bridesmaids gifts, and wedding accessories\n\n✓ View our entire Northwind collection here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/NorthwindSupply\n\n✓ Read all of the great reviews about Northwind: https://www.etsy.com/shop/NorthwindSupply#reviews\n\n© All images and designs are the property of NorthwindSupply.com",

If you have this kind of paint consider applying your decal to a painted canvas or painted board instead.  \nRead more about this in our FAQS below.\n\nFree test decals are available if you are unsure about your paint type.  Just message us with your full name and address for mailing.\n\nSend us a photo of your new wall designs. We love to see what our customers have done with their decals.\n\nMade in the USA\n\nEasy to follow instructional videos can be found here on our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZArbXELhILFEW7BQ-SAyJw/\n\nEnjoy your new vinyl wall decals!\n\nOh, one last thing…. if you would like to receive 25% off your entire order, you can sign up for our VIP email list and we will send you a coupon code you can use today on your entire order.\nHere’s the link to sign up: https://www.wordybirdstudios.com/discount\n\n\n© Copyright Wordy Bird Studios LLC 2017.

This set features a date and initials chosen by you with a heart on each.\n\nThe price is for a set of 2 keyrings.\n\nEach half  measures 50 x 15 mm.\n\nThis piece is made from aluminium which is a great alternative to sterling silver as it is super lightweight, does not tarnish and has a lower chance of reacting to your skin.\n\nEach piece is hand stamped which means that each letter, number, symbol and design is stamped one at a time by hand. Because of the hand made nature of my stamped jewellery, some letters may not be 100% perfectly aligned or all the same depth. This makes each piece completely unique and special.\n\nAll my products are handmade by me in United Kingdom. Please bear this in mind when ordering from overseas as it will impact upon your delivery timescale.\n\nUK postage:\nAll orders are sent using Royal Mail standard 1st class service unless you choose shipping upgrade at checkout.\n\nInternational postage:\nAll orders are sent using Royal Mail International Tracked service.",

Each cutting board is examined carefully prior to beginning the engraving process. Each board is sanded and finished with a high-quality food grade butcher block conditioner made from mineral oil and natural waxes so the cutting board will be immediately available for use upon arrival.\n\nPlease be aware that every cutting board is made from different wood and is unique! Some boards may engrave slightly lighter or darker than the photo shows.",

            "description": "***DISCLAIMER: Photos are representative photos from previous projects and may or may not look like the product you will receive. Shelves are SOLD INDIVIDUALLY. Reclaimed wood is just that, reclaimed. It is VERY distressed/ rustic, contains holes of all sizes, knots, has cracks (which do not affect the integrity of the wood, i.e partial thickness, can be varying colors within a piece, can be slightly warped or bowed and is largely imperfect. In addition wood is cut and sold in nominal dimensions meaning thickness and depth can vary by up to 1/2”. A 2x4 you buy at your home improvement store is not 2x4. This is industry standard. With that being said we cannot warranty against any of those things which occur in the natural process of aging and due to exposure to elements, oils, foot traffic, chemicals, etc. We do not warranty against color choice as each board may take color somewhat differently. This is the case with all finishes on the market outside of paint which we do not use. We do not send out brackets first as we need your brackets to drill proper holes to ensure a proper fit. Please DO NOT order shelves on two different occasions for the same space. THEY WILL NOT MATCH, they were never meant to match. This is reclaimed wood and this is not possible. Recipe for disaster!Please make an educated decision as to whether reclaimed wood is the right product for your project. We cannot accept returns or exchanges outside of an error on our part, as this is a service business with a great deal of overhead and employees and we must get paid for our labor. Cancellation requests must be received within 7 days from order date as these pieces are all custom made, made to order. We cannot ship to Alaska or Hawaii due to the weight of our product and the extreme cost of shipping such. Unfortunately all orders received will have to be canceled and refunded.\n\n***Finish in the primary photo is clear wax. “Clear” is not a color, it’s translucent and is offered to serve as a wood protectant only. PLEASE DO NOT base your color selection on the clear wax photo. Again, this is not a color and the finished product will vary greatly depending on how light or dark the wood ended up after sanding. \n\nThis listing is for 1 custom made HEAVY-DUTY reclaimed wood floating shelf with steel bracket. These shelves are rated to hold between 60 to 300 lbs. of evenly distributed weight based on their length and when mounted into wall studs. These shelves are made using 6&quot;, 7.5&quot;, 9.5&quot; and 11” deep nominal lumber and are available in lengths up to 84&quot; long. The back steel bracket contains 2 or more steel posts (the longer the shelf the more posts) and gets affixed to the wall using anchors and #8 by 2” long wood screws into your wall studs and drywall. The shelf has holes drilled into the back. You simply push the shelf backward and evenly onto the posts, up against the bracket. These shelves look great anywhere and hold a great deal of weight! \n\n***Bracket Sizing Chart: Your shelf bracket will most closely match size of shelf you order.\n\n3/4 inch rod diameter \n10 inch- 2 rods 6 inch spacing (rated to hold 50 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n16 inch- 2 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 100 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n22 inch- 2 rods 18 inch spacing (rated to hold 100 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n28 inch- 3 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 100 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n34 inch- 3 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 150 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n40 inch- 4 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 150 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n46 inch- 4 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 150 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n58 inch- 5 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 200 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n70 inch- 6 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 250 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n82 inch- 7 rods 12 inch spacing (rated to hold 300 lbs of evenly distributed weight when mounted into wall studs)\n\n***Actual dimensions of an 8&quot; piece of lumber are 7.5&quot; to 7.75&quot; and a 10&quot; piece of lumber measures 9.5&quot; to 9.75&quot; just like milled wood you&#39;d purchase at your local lumber yard.

            "description": "grow. dammit. rustic garden stake is easy to add to a large planter or place anywhere in the landscape or garden. It&#39;s a large enough size to stand out on its own but still fits into planters. Great gift for apartment dwellers and extreme gardeners alike!\n\nThe face of the Small grow. dammit. stake is 8&quot; wide and 4&quot; tall. The naturally rusted finish option is slightly larger, but a very similar match to our Classic Garden Markers. It&#39;s cut from steel about as thick as a nickel. The stake is roughly 20&quot; tall overall. Naturally rusted signs have been pre-soaked to begin the rusting process. The patina will only improve with age!\n\nThe Medium is 23&quot; tall with a face 11 1/2 x 6.5&quot; in size. Large is 28&quot; tall with a 15 x 9&quot; face.\n\nColor choices are made with a durable powder coated finish. Signs are safe to leave out in all weather.\n\nPlease note that the naturally rusted option is made of naturally rusted steel. Irregular colors are to be expected, and with time outdoors the entire item will turn a golden rusty brown. Rusted steel can stain fabrics and leave residue on your hands. Please be aware that the item may have sharp edges. Gardening gloves are recommended. This item is not intended as an indoor product.\n\nThe original grow. dammit. garden stake is a local favorite! We hope you love it as much as our local fans do!\nAll of our items are 100% made in USA and made to last!",

It is suitable for both women and men. \n\nThe listing is for one ring. Please choose quantity &quot;2&quot; for two rings and leave a note with the second requested size at checkout.\n\nMaterial - 9k Yellow gold, 4mm wide, 1.2mm thick \n\nSize Guide - Measure the finger at room temperature using a 1/2 inch wide paper, not a string. If you hesitate between two sizes, go with the larger one. For example, a wide ring or a stack of rings needs a bigger size. When the knuckle is much larger than the finger&#39;s base, measure both and select a size between the two.\nRecommended - Please check with a specialized jewelry shop for the correct size.\n\nThe 2nd picture features a happy couple wearing the rings I made.\n\nThe pictures were taken in close-up to show the details and do not indicate the size or scale. Therefore, please read the detailed listing description and use a measurement ruler.\n\nThe processing time is around two weeks from the time of payment, excluding Fridays, Saturdays, and public holidays. When possible, due to the work volume, it will be ready to ship earlier.\n\nThe current carrier is DHL Express, with estimated delivery for most destinations, in two to four days from the pickup date.\n\nEach piece is unique, with the attributes of handmade jewelry designed and made by Dany B.\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/VenexiaJewelry",

            "description": "Our best-selling personalized rainbow crayons from the Original Rainbow Crayon® shop of Etsy make the best fall birthday and personalized holiday gifts for kids!\n\nShop children&#39;s birthday gifts from the best name crayons Etsy has with over 15 years of colorful rainbow crayon fun! Your kids art supplies and craft project ideas will pop with color with our personalized crayon gift set.\n\nOur custom Original Rainbow Crayon® Name Sets are the standout gift for your next birthday gift, thank you gift, or event favors need.   We ship fast with FREE domestic shipping. Each crayon letter is easy to hold and features an array of bright colors, which blend together in endless combinations as you create your masterpiece.\n\nAre Personalized Crayons for kids ready to gift?\n\nYes, personalized crayons are ready for gifting with hand-stamped personalization on the outside of each gift box.  Each letter is individually packaged for safe shipping and a decorative tie around the outside of the kraft box is included for a finishing touch. \n\n\nThe Original Rainbow Crayon® was the first crayon shop to create a personalized crayon name set and have been a part of the Etsy community for over 14 years. \n\nAs Seen In: \n*NBC News\n*Forbes\n*The Washington Post\n*The Drew Barrymore Show\n*Etsy Design Awards Finalist- Kids Category\n*Good Morning America\n*Today\n*USA Today\n*Redbook Magazine \n*Midwest Living \n*US WEEKLY\n*Best Products\n*People \n*Buzzfeed\n*Southern Living\n*Parents Canada\n*Cool Mom Picks \n*Today&#39;s Bride\n\n  This listing is for 1-4 Rainbow Crayon letters in a gift box with the name or word stamped on the front of the box. Additional letters can be added when checking out from the drop down menu. \n\n**PLEASE READ ALL INFORMATION BELOW FOR BOX SIZES v. NAME SIZES. There are 3 different sizes of boxes we use depending on how long the name is. \n\nPlease use the personalization field to write the name needed as you add to cart and check out. Additional Notes can be written in the &quot;message to seller&quot; box at checkout. \n\nUp to 5  letters fit best in the standard, long box (approx 8&quot;x2&quot; -as shown in &quot;JAMES&quot; listing photo).\n\n6-8 Letters fit in the wider, rectangle box in two rows (approx 5.5&quot; x 4&quot;). See photo of CAMERON in the listing for box size.\n\nDue to limited space in the jewelry boxes, any name over 8 letters will be placed in a larger, (third size) 5&quot; x 7&quot; box and finished with the stamped name and rainbow yarn. We do our best to fit everything in the standard two sizes of jewelry boxes, but want to ensure safe shipping and prevent letters from breaking (especially names with letters M,W,N, which are wider). \n\nOur Rainbow Crayon Letters measure approx. 1.5-2&quot;, but will vary depending on the actual letter (&quot;M&quot; will be wider than the letter &quot;L&quot; for example)  - Not recommended for children under 4 due to parts that could break off. \n\nColors for crayons will vary. Please click though photos to see the range of our work. Arrangement of color combinations will differ from set to set with variations of darks and lights. We do our best to accommodate color requests.\n\nOutside yarn/string on the box is subject to change from listing photos depending on the season and holiday. \n\n**We are the Original Rainbow Crayon® shop on Etsy and the first shop to sell a handmade crayon (est. 2007).  Thank you for supporting handmade! **\n\n*Follow us on Instagram (@art2theextreme) for more photos and packaging examples of both sizes of boxes!",

            "description": "Welcome to Bell & the Whistle.  We&#39;re a small woodshop in rural Arkansas, and we love making unique and special decorations for our customers.\n\nScroll through the pictures above to see our COLOR CHART and KEY HOLE hanging option.\n\nWe offer 4 stock sizes to choose from.  Please note that the height is measured from the top of the &#39;th&#39; to the bottom of the &#39;g&#39;.  The length is measured from the tips of the swashes on each side.\n42&quot; x 11&quot;\n36&quot; x 9.5&quot;\n28&quot; x 7.25&quot;\n22&quot; x 5.75\n\nHOW IT&#39;S MADE:\nLettering is cut from 1/2&quot; birch plywood using a CNC router which creates a clean and consistent cut.  Each piece is sanded on front and back before being painted to your color choice. If you would like a distressed finish, we sand the paint to create this rustic look. To get this option, mention it in the Notes box at check-out. \n\nWALL HANGING:\nOur key hole hanging option is a ready-to-hang system and includes all the hardware you need for mounting to wood or drywall.  Key hole slots are cut in the back of the word and screws are included. This hanging method is sturdy and invisible. All you will need is a Phillips-head screwdriver.  Select this option in the dropdown menu on the left before adding to your cart. \n\nOur standard option does not include hanging hardware.  Some good methods for hanging are: Command Strips, glue, or small nails in the open spaces of the letters.  \n\nBecause of the nature of the lettering, it is somewhat fragile and we recommend hanging it securely and out of reach of kids or pets. \n\nLEAD TIME:\nEach item is made to order. Our lead time is approximately 1-2 weeks after receiving payment. Items are shipped using USPS priority mail which arrives in 2-3 days. We cannot guarantee shipping times; these are just estimates. We pack our orders carefully with double-wall corrugated cardboard. Recycled packaging materials may be used.",

            "title": "Tabletop Glass Fireplace, Gifts for him! 2 sizes: Warm up your patio & heart with this lantern, add some light, and even roast S&#39;mores, too!",
            "description": "&gt;&gt;UPDATE: Our Tabletop Fireplace design has been adapted to a much thicker wood. This will hold up even better in outdoor conditions. There is a richer grain pattern in this wood, which is different from what is pictured. The structure and cuteness remain the same! Updated photos to follow soon!\n\nDESCRIPTION: \nLooking for something unique to brighten up your outdoor entertaining space? Maybe you want to warm up your perfect indoor space, as well.  Add a mini-fireplace to your next gathering to enjoy the dancing flame for hours.  \n\nWith gel fuel, this lantern lights instantly and can be controlled easily for safety.  The glass adds interest with reflections, but can also be removed quickly for making dessert, like S&#39;mores!  When you&#39;re done, just refill the gel for next time.\n\nThis kit is made up of a few parts:  The base is a natural birch, it&#39;s wood that can be stained or painted.  If you plan on leaving it outdoors, a finish should be applied. 4 pieces of glass make up the top.  The base comes as 11 pieces that snap together easily without glue or special hardware in minutes.  \n\nThe actual flame is a nice steady glow, mostly blue with a few orange highlights.  The nature of night photography enhances the flame seen in the photo to appear larger.  Other fuels may produce different results (See disclaimer above.)\n\n*Second photo is an actual customer using our Fireplace in their home.. I couldn&#39;t be more proud to show it!\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n• All 3 kits ship flat-packed, unassembled, and ready to get your inner child excited.\n• After unpacking and following the Quick Start guide that comes with it, or the full detailed assembly instructions found on our website (onemanonegarage.com) you will put your new creation to the test. Turn it on, dim the lights, and be mesmerized!\n• If you are giving this as a gift we strongly recommend you let the recipient enjoy the assembling process. They will love you for the experience you&#39;re giving them!\n• Only the Basic and Deluxe are suitable for use with Sterno Gel Fuel. The Mini uses a candle only.\n\nMEARUREMENTS:\n• 2 sizes when assembled: \n• Mini 3&quot;x3&quot;x4&quot; tall\n• Basic 6&quot;x6&quot;x9&quot; tall\n• Deluxe 6&quot;x6&quot;x9&quot; tall\n\nWHAT&#39;S IN THE BOX:\n• MINI: Box set includes 4 bevel glass panes, all the wooden parts for the Base, a Quick start Guide and Tea Light Candle.\n• BASIC: Box set includes 4 flat glass panes, all the wooden parts for the Base, and a Quick start Guide. (*You supply a safe amount of Sand and Decorative Stones, or Glass pebbles, plus Gel Fuel or candle, not included)\n• DELUXE: Box set includes 4 flat glass panes, all the wooden parts for the Base, roasting sticks, Lava Stones and Heat Resistant Sand necessary for use, and a Quick start Guide. \n• DELUXE: Box set includes 4 Beveled glass panes, all the wooden parts for the Base, roasting sticks, Lava Stones and Heat Resistant Sand necessary for use, and a Quick start Guide. \n(*Gel Fuel or candle, not included) \n\n\nWARNING:\n• Be cautious, especially with children around. This item has some pointy parts. \n• Glass can be fragile. Take caution with intense heat.  Avoid direct contact with the flame, specially in breezy situations.\n• Heat Resistant Sand: Either supply your own or opt for the Deluxe kit to include it. Lay down a bed of sand to rest the 2.6oz can of Gel Fuel (Sterno) can. Sand protects the wood base from the direct heat.\n• Never leave an open flame unattended, either Indoors or Out.  Under unsure conditions, consider working with a Candle or LED light.\n\nNot sure how you assemble it? Find the complete build instructions on our website:\nhttps://onemanonegarage.com/pages/support\nYou&#39;ll find all our PDF files to view and download\n\n*DUE TO SHIPPING REGULATIONS, FUEL CAN NOT BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE KIT. A 2.6oz can of Sterno is fairly inexpensive, easy to find, and can be refilled cheaply as well. (Order from Amazon for quick delivery if you prefer. A 3pk is about $6) According to Sterno, their 2.6oz can burns for up to 45min.\n\n*Designs may vary slightly from the photos, as improvements get worked into the new versions!",

            "description": "Available for shipping within 2 days of placing order: 2 Black Walnut Guitars; 3 Cherry Guitars; 1 Black Walnut, Cherry & Oak Banjo; 1 Oak Ukulele.  All others will be shipped within listed processing times.\n\nThese are a great way to keep all your picks in one place! The wooden pick cases are available in 5 designs: banjo, guitar, dobro, mandolin & ukulele.   Individually hand made of solid wood and felt lined, they can easily be stored in your instrument case (excludes ukulele) or left out on display in your home. Have a decorative brass clasp and leather hinges & handle. \n\nPerfect for gift giving they are a unique keepsake trinket box for any musician.  Ideal for celebrating 5th (traditional), 6th (modern) or 7th (desktop) anniversaries.  They add a personalized touch as a wedding party gift and can be used as a wedding ring holder.\n\nOrder of instruments in photos: Guitar, Dobro, Banjo, Ukulele and Mandolin\n\nAvailable in choice of woods Cherry, Black Walnut and Oak as shown in the order of the pictures showing the single instrument.  \n  \nThe cases are clear coated not stained to show the beauty of the wood grain.   All wood varies in the shades and grains and can be lighter or darker than shown in the pictures. \n\nThe Guitar and Dobro Pick Cases holds approximately 30 picks.  The Dobro case will comfortably fit the slide and picks.  The Banjo Pick Case can several sets of finger picks depending on the size.  The Mandolin and Ukulele Pick Case holds approximately 12 picks.\n\nApproximate Size: \n  Guitar and Dobro       7.25” X  4.50” X  1.25”\n  Banjo                            7.25” X  2.75” X  1.25”\n  Mandolin                     5.00” X 2.75” X  1.25” \n  Ukulele                         5.00&quot; X 2.50&quot; X  1.25&quot;\n\nMAKING THE CASES:\nI start out by cutting the pick cases in batches not one at a time.  The shipping time varies depending on how far along the process is when you place the order.   I do not post an available wood until it is rough cut. Pick Cases ship for free.  Returned or exchanged item may require postage.\n\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING:\nFree shipping is approximately a 4-day expected delivery.   Priority is a 3-day expected delivery with insurance at a discounted rate.\n\nFOREIGN PURCHASES:\nIf your country is not listed below the shipping charges will be determined on an individual basis depending on destination. We recommend ordering at least 3-6 weeks in advance. We ship US Postal Service and most items leave the US within 3-5 days. The designated country delivery date depends on that postal service. Some countries require up front collection of fees and taxes, others do not.  Please be aware of your country&#39;s requirements as we are not responsible for any additional fees or taxes levied by the recipients country.",

We created our Horse Breath lip balm with the idea that maybe we could fool ourselves into believing horses had better breath. I mean, it&#39;s not exactly fresh grass or that sweet smell of sweet feed drizzled in molasses... This is our take on Horse Breath...what we dream it SHOULD be! Rosemary and Peppermint compliment each other nicely, and so we combined them in our Horse Breath Lip Balm! \n\nKeep your lips happy and healthy, and keep smiling! Maybe even your horse will smile back (maybe he actually thinks YOU have the bad breath?)  We added organic hemp oil in this batch to give it a light green color to mimic the naturalness of a grazing on grass. Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t turn your lips green, Hemp oil is amazing for your skin! \n\nOur Horse Breath lip balm is cooling, not hot and sweaty smelling. It makes a great gift for that horse lover in your life. It makes a great gift for a man (It&#39;s not too girly!) Keep it in your purse, in your saddle bag, with your horse gear... heck, maybe you don&#39;t even like horses?! (GASP)\n\n**This lip balm may make you feel a tingling sensation on your lips**\n\n®®INGREDIENTS: Organic Beeswax, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Unrefined Coconut Oil, Organic Hemp Seed oil, Organic castor oil, Rosemary essential oil, peppermint essential oil.\n\nYou can feel confident knowing that our products are:\n\n® Non GMO\n® Soy, Corn, Sugar and Gluten Free\n® Chemical, Preservative and Paraben Free\n® Sulfite and Phthalate Free\n® Cruelty Free\n\nIf this isn&#39;t what you&#39;re looking for, feel free to explore our other flavors of Organic, all Natural Lip Balms:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/redbarnbotanicalsllc?section_id=18280613\n\n\nSTORAGE: The nature of this lip balm causes it to get soft in high heat. Don&#39;t keep in your pocket for long periods of time, or store in a hot vehicle in the warm months. If it does get soft, stand it upright in a fridge for about 30 minutes and it&#39;ll return to its solid state!\n\nIf you are looking for bulk quantities of 25 or more of our Organic All Natural Lip Balms, we have them available!

And just to add to the fun, flip back the hatch on the top to drop the dice into the tower!\n\nThe detailed engraving and added dial pointers and bolts, together with the cutout slots in the tower, make this dice tower a real talking point.   As you drop the dice into the tower, you can watch them rattling through the baffles onto the tray.\n\nMeasures 168 x 100 x 100 when closed (including the bolts on the side) and 200mm high with the tower in place.  \n\nThe drawer is kept closed when the tower is lowered, ensuring your dice stay put…\n\nMade from our trademark hardwood 3.5mm ply, this is laser cut before assembly and finished with several coats of varnish to protect and bring out the beauty of the wood.\n\nAll our products are wrapped with paper bubble wrap before boxing up, then recycled paper fill is carefully packed around the box to protect it on it&#39;s journey to you - our boxes are recyclable and eco-friendly and we endeavour be as sustainable as possible.",

            "description": "OUR TOP SELLER! \nCHARLOTTE Font - see an image of your name in this font by copying and pasting the following link into your browser: https://www.previewmyname.com/\n\nWE WILL SHIP OUT YOUR UNPAINTED ORDER IN 48 HOURS OR IT’S FREE!* (Please see shop policies for details.)\n\nOther shops make you wait weeks or months to get your order. We are putting a stop to that. “Custom” is no longer synonymous with long wait times. \n\n*Please note that paint adds an additional 3 business days (to allow for paint application and dry time). We paint the front and sides of our pieces (NOT the back).\n\nFULLY CUSTOMIZED~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGet your name (or any word you would like) cut from wood to display beautifully in your home. Perfect for children&#39;s names in their room or nursery, family last names over the fireplace, “Let’s Eat” in the kitchen, or “Splish Splash” in the bathroom. The options are endless!\n\nORDERING~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*Our sizing is based off of the total width of the name (from left to right), NOT the height. The height varies depending on the letters and font, so if you need exact measurements on the height, please contact us first. \n\n*If you would like to order a first and middle name and select one as your quantity (such as Lucy Mae at 42&quot; wide), please keep in mind that the 2 names will measure a *total* width of the size you select. (We do not recommend ordering a size smaller than 42&quot; wide for 2 names.)\n\n* Please let us know the name(s) or word(s) you are wanting in the Personalization field, exactly as you would like the finished product. Please leave a VERY specific note if you want your word all lowercase.\n\n*If you have a lowercase &quot;i&quot; or &quot;j&quot; please let us know if you would like us to connect the dot to the letter, or if you would like it sent loose. If no note is given, we will automatically ship it CONNECTED.\n\n*Please note that the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; on the end of a name in Charlotte font will come with the additional curl on the end unless otherwise noted by customer before production. \n\n*Please note that unless there are VERY specific instructions given, we will automatically cut all orders with the first letter of the word or name uppercase and all other letters lowercase.  (Example: jennifer will be cut as Jennifer, unless a note is included to make all letters lowercase.)\n\nPROOFS~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe provide proofs after purchase and by request only.  Please note that we cannot guarantee that your unpainted name will ship within 48 hours when a proof is requested, due to proof design and response wait time.\n\nSPECS~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*Sizes range from 12&quot; to 55&quot; wide (from left to right of your entire name). The height varies depending on the letters, so if you need exact measurements on the height, please contact us first.  Keep in mind, the more letters in the name, the smaller the font will become.  The name Lucy at 36&quot; wide will be MUCH taller than the name Annabelle at 36&quot; wide.\n\n*Cut from ½” Baltic Birch wood.\n\n*Please note, our pieces do not come with any hanging hardware.\n\nADD-ON OPTIONS~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDon&#39;t want to put nails in the wall? For our indoor double-sided tape, add this listing to your cart:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/293122085\n\n*Please note that our products DO NOT come with any hanging hardware.*\n\nMORE FONTS & SIZES~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/48HourMonogram/?section_id=18551718\n\n* You are ordering your name in the displayed font, but please checkout the &quot;Custom Names&quot; section of our shop to see all available options, or send us a message if you have a different font in mind.  We can also make custom sizes, if needed (contact us for pricing).\n\nThank you for shopping with us!\n~The 48-Hour Monogram Team",

And it can always be different: different colors, different patterns on the fabric. \n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nPERSONALIZATION:\nBifold: Total 4 places for personalization - front, inside 2 places, back.\nTrifold: Total 7 places for personalization - front, inside 5 places, back.\n\nPlease note that initially each wallet is empty, without any personalization. If you choose the No personalization option, then your wallet is completely clean. \nYour wallet will only have your personalization that you send to us. All photo item is a sample of what we can do. And many more that you want to engrave.\n\n- FRONT: usually front engrave initials/monogram, but at your request, we can put them anywhere in your wallet: any picture, photo, logo, your handwriting, etc.\nSee item photo for examples of initials and monograms. But we can also make any of your designs.\n\n- INSIDE: You can see all places for engraving in the item photos. \n\n- BACK: same space like front, for engraving any picture, photo, logo, your handwriting, etc.\n\nYour personalization write in personalization box, or in a note to the order, or in conversation. \nWe will put text of any length under your responsibility. But remember - the longer the text, the smaller the font and poor readability.\nYou can use any fonts for your engravings. Please choose font from Office-Word or from Google and write me the font name.\nIf you do not specify the name of the font and place for engraving, then we do this at our discretion.\n\nIf you do not want your text was in quotation marks, do not write them, please.\n\nThe engraving on the leather always turns out differently and the color is impossible to predict. Since leather is a natural material, and the color of the engraving depends on the ph composition of the leather. It happens darker, it happens lighter. The quality is always good, the engraving will never be erased, but over time, the color may also change: it may become darker or lighter.\nPlease note that for better visibility of the engraving, do not look at a right angle at the wallet. You need to hold the wallet in your hands at an angle to the light source, as in all my photos, then the engraving is perfectly visible.\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nCONTACT:\nIf you have questions how to order and how to choose the personalization option, then do not hesitate to ask! Write messages that promise to respond within 12 hours.\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nWe suggest you visit the other stores of our family&#39;s creativity!\n\n&quot;LeatheRinGoods&quot; Personalized leather keychains \nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/LeatheRinGoods?ref=hdr_shop_menu\n\n&quot;KolesovArt&quot; Paintings on Canvas\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/KolesovArt?ref=hdr_shop_menu\n\nThank you for your visit! \nEnjoy the shopping!",

            "description": "Made from recycled paper, rainbow pencils let you create beautiful paper rainbows when you sharpen them.\n\nThey function like regular pencils, but they&#39;re not made from wood, they&#39;re made from lots of layers of recycled waste paper. So the shavings / sharpenings look like rainbows!!!\n\nEach pencil has a 6-layer rainbow core and comes finished in a final layer of black or white.\n\nA simple design that makes a great gift or back to school supply.\n\nNAME REFERENCES\n&quot;White&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; refer to the final, outer layer of paper the pencils are finished in.\n\nGRAPHITE / &quot;LEAD&quot; COLOUR\nStandard grey HB (#2 US)\n\nFINISH\nEach pencil is printed with logo on one side and “rainbow pencil by duncan shotton” on the other, in grey.\nThe outer (black or white) layers of each pencil are also made from recycled paper. The finish of each pencil is therefore never ‘perfect’ and will contain marks and imperfections, as is standard of recycled paper.\n\nMAKING RAINBOWS\nYou don’t need a special sharpener to make rainbows, but a sharp, good quality one will help you make better ones. To improve your rainbows, you can try sharpening from the other end of the pencil, using a better sharpener or applying a more constant force when turning the pencil. Trying to make the perfect rainbow is all part of the fun!\n\n★ instagram / twitter → @_dshott ★ \n\n-------\n\n★ Designed by British designer Duncan Shotton, Made in Korea.\n★ 178mm x 25mm x 8.5mm / 25g (outer pack dimensions)\n★ 173mm long / 7g (individual pencil)\n\n-------\n\nStationery. (Not Stationary!)\n\nAll items are sent within 5 working days (but normally same/next day) from the UK via Royal Mail.\nFor more info, see shop policies : https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dshott/policy\n\nKeep up to date by following me via insta/newsletter/twitter/vimeo/fb (links in shop announcement)\n\n★ To see my full range of products, visit dshott.co.uk",

Orders generally take 3-5 business days for processing and production. Shipping times also vary, depending on the shipping option chosen (standard, expedited, etc.), but standard shipping is usually 3-4 business days. These are rough estimates, and sometimes there are unforeseen delays, longer production and shipping times during peak/holiday seasons, etc. I strive to get things turned around as quickly as possible, however, and will do my best to message you via Etsy, should I become aware of specific delays. I promise I want for you to receive your cute items as quickly as absolutely possible! Should you need things more quickly or rushed, please send me an Etsy message BEFORE purchasing so I can let you know if I am able to accommodate. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: Colors may vary slightly from computer screen to printer and then onto printed material, or even from one printer to the next. The design will likely be slightly less bright than what you see on your computer screen.\n\n************************************\n\nFOLLOW More Than Most on Instagram:\n@morethanmostshop\n\nLIKE Simply PRINTly on Facebook: \nwww.facebook.com/morethanmostshop\n\nFor special offers, promotions, discounts, coupon codes, and more!\n\n************************************\n\nThis item is for personal use ONLY.

As soon as a bit of water hits the shower bomb, it will emit the aroma in order to fill your shower room with the tantalizing scent. Drop one in your shower and get ready to let the fragrance slowly tease and envelop your senses.\n\nSince they are made out of natural ingredients, these shower bombs can be enjoyed by the entire family. Kids love them, moms love them and dads do too!\n\nDirections: Place an unwrapped shower bomb on the floor in the back/corner of your shower away from the direct stream of water or it will dissolve quickly and you won&#39;t feel the benefits of it or on a shelf within the stall before turning on the warm water and it will gradually dissolve all while releasing its vapors. You can also use the scented bomb outside of the shower by placing it in a bowl of hot water and sitting next to it as you breathe in the aromatic vapor.\n\nThis listing is for 4 or 9 shower bombs shrink-wrapped and packaged in a zip-tight bag to preserve freshness.\n\nIngredients: Epsom salts, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), citric acid, fragrance &/or essential oils.\n\nNote: We do use natural mica as a colorant and we would suggest using a small bowl or plate to put the steamer on just to be safe to avoid staining your shower.\n\n\nScents: We use the same scents for our shower bombs and soaps. You can find out more about the scents in each of the soap descriptions. www.etsy.com/shop/GorgeousSoap?section_id=16412717\n\n\n► Variety Bag: Each shower bomb is shrink-wrapped with a label and you can mix and match varieties for this 4 or 9 shower bombs bag! Just make a note how many of each in the comment section when ordering! If no choices are included in the order we will pick from our bestsellers for you!

            "description": "I created these modern cobalt blue lapis lazuli earrings by stacking hand cut 1/4” (6mm) cubes of lapis stones on my hammered sterling silver earwires. The natural deep blue colour of the stone is highlighted by pyrite inclusions and organic patterns. These earrings have a great pop of colour that can edge into almost navy and are perfect with a pair of jeans. The variation in the stones enhances the organic and modern feel of these earrings. Shown on the model in 1 1/2” length.\n\nThese earrings are available in your choice of sterling silver or hypoallergenic niobium earwires. Niobium is often recommended for people with sensitivities to metal and is a dark grey colour, similar to oxidized sterling silver.\n\nThe earrings are just under 1 1/2&quot; (36mm) long and will be shipped in a splurge gift tin. Please expect natural variation in these stones and in each pair of handmade earrings. This earring design is also available in different stones and colours as a custom order. Examples are shown of some of the stones available. Please contact me for a custom pair!\n\nA matching necklace can be found here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/270200534/lapis-necklace-lapis-lazuli-pendant-blue?ref=shop_home_active_1\n\nThis design, made with Swarovski crystal pearls, is here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/882402870/white-pearl-earrings-in-sterling-silver\n\nAdditional modern artisan jewelry can be found in my shop here:\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/Splurge?ref=si_shop",

I look forward to Christmas each year and love the chance to enjoy the season with those I love most.  In my neck of the woods, this wonderful time of year is filled with &quot;Merry Christmas Y&#39;all!&quot; and there&#39;s no better place to post the greeting than in a fun door hanger.  Hang it to welcome all those precious holiday guests.  :)\n\nThis piece is cut from 1/4&quot; thick wood and painted in the color of your choice.  The hanger is shown here in green.  You can find a preview of our other color options in the listing&#39;s pictures.  We finish the piece off with an attached wire hanger and a bright, multi-colored bow.  So, it arrives ready to hang and enjoy!  \n\nPlease note that the ribbon colors and pattern may vary from those shown in the sample photos, but we promise they will be super-cute and there&#39;s no doubt that each one will include our signature burlap!  :)\n\nThe wooden portion of this design measures 22&quot; in diameter.  The attached wire hanger adds a few inches to the overall height of the piece, but is not included in the listed measurement.  \n\nThank you for visiting Needmore Heart!\n\nCheck our our other great listings here:  https://www.etsy.com/shop/NeedmoreHeart",
